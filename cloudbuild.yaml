# In order to merge all the deployment steps into a single command, we can use Cloud Build.
# This file defines the steps that will be followed by Cloud Build to build our application.
# Check this documentation on how to tag and push to Artifact Registry:
# https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling#pushing

# I have moved all the hardcoded names to `substitutions`.
# The idea is that Cloud Build will take the variables from the `substitutions` attribute if no other values have been specified.
# More on this: https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values#using_user-defined_substitutions
# With this change any user should be able to select the region they want as well as the repositories and image names by changing those values.


steps:
  # Use Docker to build and tag the image.
  # Note that it's the same build command used earlier but it's using the AR's format for the tag.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', '${_ARTIFACT_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_ARTIFACT_REPO}/${_DOCKER_IMAGE}', '.']
  # Push the Docker image to Artifact Registry. This way we make the image public to the rest of the team.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['push', '${_ARTIFACT_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_ARTIFACT_REPO}/${_DOCKER_IMAGE}']
  # Deploy the Docker image to Cloud Run. Notice that it uses the same parameters that we were listing to deploy.
  # With Cloud Build we have managed to have all the parameters in one place and reduce the margin of error.
- name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
  entrypoint: gcloud
  args: [
          'run', 'deploy', '${_RUN_SERVICE}',
          '--image', '${_ARTIFACT_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_ARTIFACT_REPO}/${_DOCKER_IMAGE}',

images:

# List of substitutions. When Cloud Build encounters a ${_} variable, it takes its default value from here.
# I have abstracted the values I had and merged them all below. This has the advantage of being quite quick in changing any settings.
